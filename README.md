# CLI-Hangman
CLI-Hangman is a hangman game that is played through the command line. Users will be given a word to guess, and a number of guesses they get. If they guess the word before the guesses fall to zero, they win, otherwise, they lose!

## Getting Started

To get started, open your terminal, navigate to the CLI-hangman directory, and then enter:
`npm install`
This will install all the node modules needed to run this program.
